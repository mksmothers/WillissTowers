    On each of the tabs above you will find the details for each of the excercises. This isn't meant to be some tricky test, there are no gotchas
    or even any specific answers to the problems. I simply hope to use this to get an idea of how you approach a problem. Feel free to do anything you
    want with this (frameworks, UI, etc) and make the implementations any way you see fit. Code behind, Razor, JavaScript, whatever you want.

    Good luck and have fun!
